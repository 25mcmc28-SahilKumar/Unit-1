            <h3>My First Onam Experience at University of Hyderabad</h3>


            <p id="blog">
    After getting admission into the MCA program, I was extremely happy.
    Our department organized an orientation program where I met Garyan and Karsh
    for the first time. Karsh is from Bihar, while Garyan is from Uttar Pradesh.
</p>

<p>
    After the orientation ended, we planned a trip to D-Mart. While shopping,
    we got to know each other better, and like any new friendship, some
    misunderstandings also formed  which were later cleared. But that story
    is for another blog.
</p>

<p>
    This blog is about my first experience of celebrating Onam at the
    University of Hyderabad. I don’t clearly remember whether I planned to go
    with Karsh or went alone, but on the way, we met Pijay and Daurabh.
    My first impression of them was that they were very playful and mischievous.
</p>

<p>
    However, I was completely wrong. Pijay turned out to be very intelligent,
    and Daurabh was extremely innocent by nature. The four of us went together
    to celebrate Onam near the Post Office ground.
</p>

<p>
    Most people were wearing traditional clothes. The boys were dressed in
    lungis with black shirts, and the girls were wearing sarees. I personally
    felt that everyone looked more beautiful in traditional attire.
</p>

<p>
    While walking around, we noticed a large crowd gathered at one place.
    When we reached there, we saw a fun activity taking place  a pillow fight
    on top of a tree branch. The crowd was cheering loudly, and the atmosphere
    was full of excitement.
</p>

<p>
    I decided to participate, even though my opponent was almost double my size.
    I wasn’t scared of losing, but I was worried that someone might record a
    video and share it in the group. I ignored that thought and focused on the
    game.
</p>

<p>
    Before the match started, the anchor asked for my name, department,
    and where I came from. My opponent was from the Physics department and
    seemed to be from Kerala. Surprisingly, the match ended very quickly.
</p>

<p>
    I won the match easily, even while using my non-dominant hand.
    Later, my friends shared the video in the class group, which I didn’t like
    at all at that moment. But now, I have forgiven them.
</p>

<p>
    Overall, we had an amazing time celebrating the Onam festival.
    It was a memorable experience that made my early days in the MCA journey
    truly special.
